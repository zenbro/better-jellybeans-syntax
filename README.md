# Better Jellybeans Syntax theme

One of the best Vim color scheme comes to Atom (third and the last time).

Many languages are already supported, but if you need support for specific one, please, open an [issue](https://github.com/zenbro/better-jellybeans-syntax/issues).

## Another port of jellybeans?!

The [first](https://github.com/javaguirre/atom-jellybeans) and the [second](https://github.com/Trevoke/jellybeans-syntax) attempt to port this color scheme did not succeed. ðŸ˜” Too many syntax elements were missing. This is another attempt, made with love and care.
